The uploaded Python script is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that processes image data for binary classification. It identifies if a parking slot is empty or occupied.
Below is an outline of its functionality:

Libraries Used:
cv2 for image processing.
numpy for data manipulation.
sklearn.model_selection for splitting data into training and testing sets.
tensorflow.keras for building and training the CNN model.
matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.

Dataset Handling:

The data is located in a folder structure Data/clf-data with subfolders empty and not_empty for the two categories.
It reads, resizes, normalizes, and converts the images to RGB format before preparing them for training.

Model Architecture:

The script defines a CNN model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model architecture includes layers for convolution, pooling, and dense connections.
